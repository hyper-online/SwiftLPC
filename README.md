# SwiftLPC: High-Performance Linear Predictive Coding in Swift

SwiftLPC is a small library that performs Linear Predictive Coding. LPC is a powerful tool in speech processing, used for efficiently encoding the spectral characteristics of speech. SwiftLPC takes full advantage of the Accelerate framework for optimal performance.

This implementation uses Burgâ€™s method and is essentially a conversion of the existing implementation in the [librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/0.10.1/generated/librosa.lpc.html#librosa.lpc) Python library.

With a native Swift implementation of this algorithm we can get significantly improved performance, and the ability to run analysis on large audio files directly on mobile devices.

### Example Usage

```swift
import SwiftLPC

let lpc = LinearPredictiveCoding()

let audioSignal: [Float] = [...]
let predictedCoefficents = lpc.computeLpc(audioSignal, order: 31)
```

### Benchmarks

Running on a 1 minute wav file on a 10-core M1 Pro.

* librosa: ~165ms
* SwiftLPC: ~60ms

2.75x speed improvement.
